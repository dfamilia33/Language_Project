# JeviDict 
Flask Python Project - (in Progress)

## Purpose
A dictionary web app to store collquial/slang words in the spanish language, to be able to be accessed through a varitey of filters
and sorting criteria. Meant to help those learning the language understand spoken spanish outside the classroom.

## Technologies

### Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* Javascript(eventually)

### Frameworks
* Flask

### Database
* SQL Alchemy

## How it works
Each word has a class that holds information about the word so a user can browse words based on criteria(timestamp,country, popularity,
etc..). That class inherits from a databse model so it can easily store itself in a database file. As of now testing is being done
through a linux ubuntu command line until deployment
