# JeviDict
Flask Python Project

## Purpose
A dictionary web app to store collquial/slang words in the spanish language, to be able to be accessed through a varitey of filters
and sorting criteria. Meant to help those learning the language understand spoken spanish outside the classroom.

##Technologies
#Languages
*HTML
*CSS
*Python
*Javascript(eventually)

#Frameworks
*Flask

#Database
*SQL Alchemy

#How it works
Each word has a class that holds information about the word so a user can browse words based on criteria(timestamp,country, popularity,
etc..). That class inherits from a databse model so it can easily store itself in a database file. As of now testing is being done
through a linux ubuntu command line until deployment
