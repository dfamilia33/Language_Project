To Do:

Update HTML Templates to Display Flags next to Words
Scale code so whole database isnt being sorted just 25 at a time
Make drop down HTML element to choose countries
Make a route that takes the country and finds word that maps to it
Make a Country model that contains a list of Post IDs
Add upvote downvote system
Add user submission form
- Add user verfication for language experts: professors, teachers, etc..
CSS Styling
Cross Platoform Integration
Deployment Database (MySQL, ProtegeSQL) - This step is trivial - continue developing in sqlite
Site Security
Register Domain
Deploy!!! Goal (02/24/19)


With database -
It would most likely be more efficient to have n number of databases already sorted
and just insert and delete into them accordingly. Otherwise my program might have 
big issues with complexity sorting huge python lists of database model instances

For each ranking and country?
What about words from an entire region?
Those will have to be parents of ind countries

Support search of words coming from multiple countries

Front end-
I will probably have to scale the boxes for mobile and all
