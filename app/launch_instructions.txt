Migration dilemna instructions:

SQLlite does not support altering columns from what I'm aware.
Only operations that work are add and drop. A while ago I changed the countries column
and this has caused problems for me while migrating.

This message would appear "No support for ALTER of constraints in SQLite dialect"

Instructions to avoid this: 
- flask db migrate 
- go the migration script associated with this
- change the commands where alembic tries to do unsupported operations in sqllite
- only include the changes you need
- flask db upgrade
- sqlite3 app/app.db
	- sqlite> .schema  (This checks if schema has been updated)
